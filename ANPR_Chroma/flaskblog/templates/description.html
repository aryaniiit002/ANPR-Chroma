    <h3>Plate Detection Method</h3>
    <img src="static/images/flowchart.png" style="margin-top: 80px; margin-left: 120px; margin-bottom: 50px">

    <p>The approach used to segment the images is Connected Component Analysis. Connected regions wil imply that all the connected pixels belong to the same object. A pixel is said to be connected to another if they both have the same value and are adjacent to each other. </p>

    <p>Car Image -> Grayscale Image -> Binary Image -> Applying CCA to get connected regions -> Detect license plate out of all connected regions (Assumptions made : width of the license plate region to the full image ranges between 15% and 40% and height of the license plate region to the full image is between 8% & 20%) </p>

    <p>Output of first step is a license plate image detected in a car image. This is provided as input to step2 and CCA is applied on this image to bound the characters in plate.Each character identified is appended into a list.

    Model is trained using SVC (4 cross fold validation) with dataset present in directory train20X20. The model is saved as finalized_model.sav which is then loaded to predict each character.

    Once the characters of plate is obtained and model is trained, the model is loaded in order to predict each character.</p>
